Laboratory for bidimensional guidance law experimentation

## Short-term goals

  * Create a simple development environment for bidimensional guidance law prototypes, such as target interception, trajectory tracking...
  * Allow real-time visualisation of trajectories and kinematics
  * Implement different point particle kinematic and dynamic models, in order to simulate simple physical phenomena

## Long-term goals
 * Include sprites and bounding boxes for 2D models, as well as inertia to physical models
 * Include optimization processes in order to resolve more complex control problems
 * Deploy neural networks/machine learning methods in order to tune guidance parameters/models and learn guidance policies
 * Expand simulations and models for the third dimension (is `pygame` enough for this goal?)
