laboratory for bidimensional guidance laws experimentations

## short-term goals

  * create a simple development environment that allows to prototype bidimensional guidance laws such as target interception, trajectory tracking...
  * allow real-time visualisation of trajectories and kinematics
  * implement different point particle kinematic and dynamic models, in order to simulate simple physic phenomena

## long-term goals
 * include sprites and bounding boxes for 2D models, as well as inertia to physical models
 * include optimization processes in order to resolve more complex control problems
 * make use of neural networks/machine learning methods in order to tune guidance parameters/models or event to learn guidance laws
 * expand simulations and models for the third dimension (is `pygame` enough for this goal?)
